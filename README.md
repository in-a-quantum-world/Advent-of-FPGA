# Advent-of-FPGA

For Jane Street's Advent of FPGA challenge, I have re-designed some of my Advent of Code solutions using a Hardware Description Language (HDL), specifically the Hardcaml library within OCaml. 
I redid the logic design of my solutions to a few challenges, with the use of combinational and sequential circuits, before turning it into Hardcaml.
